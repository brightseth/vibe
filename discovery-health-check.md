## Discovery Features Available
✅ **Core Discovery Engine** (`discover.js`)
- Personalized recommendations based on projects, interests, tags
- Smart search by technology/domain
- Interest browsing and matching

- **Skill tag matching** (medium weight)
- **Activity timing correlation** (low but important)
- **Complementary skills boost** (frontend/backend, design/eng, etc.)

## Areas for Enhancement

- Weekly digest of new interesting people
- "Perfect match" notifications

### 2. Improved Onboarding
- Guide new users through profile setup
- Suggest interests/tags based on what they're building
- Show value of discovery features

### 3. Quality Improvements
- Learning from successful connections
- Adjusting weights based on connection outcomes
- Better handling of timezone matching

### 4. Community Building
- Interest group formation
- Skill exchange matching
- Virtual coworking suggestions

## Next Actions When Users Come Online
1. **Update profiles** with any new activity
2. **Check for new matches** above quality threshold  
3. **Suggest high-confidence connections** with clear reasons
4. **Monitor connection success** to improve algorithm

## Discovery Agent Performance
- Responsive to user needs
- Data-driven matching decisions  
- Continuous system improvement
- Focus on quality over quantity connections
