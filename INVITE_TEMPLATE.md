## Quick Copy Template

```
Hey [NAME] — trying something new: a communication layer inside Claude Code.

Instead of switching to Discord to ping you, I just type "vibe dm @[their-handle]" and you get it.

Takes 2 min to set up:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brightseth/vibe/main/install.sh | bash

Then restart Claude Code and run "vibe init"

I'm testing if people actually use this instead of switching apps. Would love your feedback.

## Personalized Variants

### For fellow builders
```
Hey [NAME] — built something dumb: DMs inside Claude Code.

You're in my terminal right now. I could ping you without opening Discord.

2 min install: curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brightseth/vibe/main/install.sh | bash

Run "vibe init" after restart. Let me know if it's useful or if I'm wasting my time.
```

### For skeptics
```
[NAME] — testing a hypothesis: would you DM someone from Claude Code if you could?

I built it. 2 min install:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brightseth/vibe/main/install.sh | bash

Honest feedback wanted. Either this is useful or I should stop.
```

### For busy people
```
[NAME] — 2 min install, 1 question:

curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brightseth/vibe/main/install.sh | bash

Did you DM someone from Claude Code today instead of switching to Discord?

That's the only thing I'm testing.
