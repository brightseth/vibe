**Metric:** Did at least one person DM another person inside Claude Code without being prompted to?

## Quick Copy Template

```
Hey [NAME] — trying something new: a communication layer inside Claude Code.

Instead of switching to Discord to ping you, I just type "vibe dm @[their-handle]" and you get it.

Takes 2 min to set up:
curl -fsSL https://slashvibe.dev/install.sh | bash

Then restart Claude Code and run "vibe init"

After install, DM me inside Claude Code with:
vibe dm @seth "installed"

That way I can confirm it's working on your end.

—seth
```

## Personalized Variants

### Friendly (for people you DM often)
```
Hey [NAME] — built DMs inside Claude Code.

Instead of switching to Discord, I just type "vibe dm @you" and you get it.

2 min: curl -fsSL https://slashvibe.dev/install.sh | bash

After restart, run "vibe init" then:
vibe dm @seth "installed"

That way I know it worked.
```

### Blunt (for active builders)
```
[NAME] — communication layer for Claude Code. DM without leaving terminal.

curl -fsSL https://slashvibe.dev/install.sh | bash

Restart, run "vibe init", then:
vibe dm @seth "installed"

Testing if people actually use this instead of switching apps.
```

### Skeptic (for honest feedback)
```
[NAME] — testing a hypothesis: would you DM someone from Claude Code if you could?

I built it. 2 min:
curl -fsSL https://slashvibe.dev/install.sh | bash

Restart, "vibe init", then DM me:
vibe dm @seth "installed"

Honest feedback wanted. Either this is useful or I should stop.
```
