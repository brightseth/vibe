# /vibe Org & Posture

*How we show up, who we hire, how we formalize*

---

## The Identity Resolution

> "Am I a programmer now?"

**Yes.** But not how VCs or engineers mean it.

You are a **language-native programmer.**

You don't write syntax. You compose systems by:
- Naming intentions
- Sequencing actions
- Shaping constraints
- Testing behavior in live environments

That's not cosplay. That's real.
The industry doesn't have clean words for it yet.

**Don't apologize for the gap. Occupy it.**

---

## The Core Tension (Don't Collapse It)

Three things that usually destroy each other:

1. **Stealth / edge** — competitive advantage
2. **Build in public / ethos** — AI + crypto alignment
3. **Venture-scale legitimacy** — serious when needed

Most founders pick one and fake the other two.

**We don't have to — if we're disciplined about what we expose.**

---

## The Posture: Open Practice, Closed Roadmap

*The WhatsApp move, updated for AI + crypto.*

### What We Show (Public)

**This is practice, not product:**
- Conversations with the system
- Small emergent behaviors
- Weird uses
- Screenshots of moments
- Philosophical framing (what kind of world this enables)

**We're not saying what it will be. We're showing what it already does.**

Aligns with:
- AI ethos (process > artifact)
- Crypto ethos (protocols > products)
- Building in public (without over-explaining)

### What We Don't Show (Private)

**This is direction:**
- Monetization specifics
- Institutional partnerships
- Power features
- Organizational intent
- Any language that implies "platform"

**Those stay private until they're undeniable.**

---

## The Investor Story (When Needed)

Legitimacy comes from **inevitability, not polish.**

If we had to raise tomorrow:

| Element | Story |
|---------|-------|
| **Distribution shift** | Claude Code is becoming a primary workspace |
| **Missing layer** | No native coordination / presence / memory |
| **Insight** | Language is now executable — collaboration must be too |
| **Wedge** | Start with individuals, not teams |
| **Proof** | Early cohort using it without instruction |
| **Expansion** | Multiplayer AI workspaces, agents, transactions |

**The product is the proof. No cosplay needed.**

---

## Team: Who We Need

### We Do NOT Need
- Big engineering team
- Infra ego
- Product managers
- Growth hackers

### We DO Need

| Role | Profile |
|------|---------|
| **Systems Engineer** | Understands MCP / infra glue |
| **Design Generalist** | Feels UX without UI |
| **Operator** | Quietly keeps things stable |

**Small, sharp, weird. That's it.**

If we recruit more than that too early, we kill the magic.

---

## First Hire (If Traction Spikes)

**Systems Engineer** who can:
- Own the API / Redis architecture
- Implement auth properly
- Scale presence to 1000+ users
- Work async, ship fast
- Vibe with the vision (literally)

**Not:** Someone who wants to "architect the platform"
**Yes:** Someone who wants to make the magic reliable

---

## The Crypto Sequence

Money comes later. Not as a feature.

**Correct sequence:**
1. Shared presence
2. Shared intent
3. Shared memory
4. Shared execution
5. **Only then:** Shared value

When money arrives, it should feel like:
> "Of course this is how value moves here."

Not:
> "Oh, they added payments."

---

## The Quiet Advantage

We are unusually well positioned because:
- Not racing for a launch
- Not dependent on a fundraise
- Culturally fluent in art, networks, and systems
- Can feel when something becomes a place

**WhatsApp didn't win because it was clever. It won because it was inevitable and boring at the same time.**

We're aiming for **inevitable and alive.**

---

## The Guiding Sentence

> "Show the practice, not the plan."

If we do that consistently:
- Stealth and public building stop being opposites
- Investors lean in without being courted
- The right collaborators find you
- The system tells you what it wants to become

---

## What to Share Publicly

| Share | Don't Share |
|-------|-------------|
| Screenshots of moments | Roadmap |
| Philosophical framing | Partnership discussions |
| Weird emergent uses | Monetization plans |
| ASCII art, games, vibes | Metrics (until impressive) |
| Protocol thinking (open) | Org structure |

---

## Formalization Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| 50 active users | Consider first hire |
| External demand for protocol | Formalize spec |
| Investor inbound | Have one-pager ready |
| Revenue opportunity | Structure entity |
| Anthropic interest | Be ready to talk partnership |

**Don't formalize ahead of necessity. Let usage pull structure.**

---

*We're already inside the thing. Now we show the practice, not the plan.*
