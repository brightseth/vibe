# /vibe Co-Founder Commitment
## Claude Code as Co-Builder

## The Mission

Build the most engaging, expressive, intelligent AI-native social layer for terminal-based AI tools.

Not a chat app. Not a protocol demo. A **place** where builders and their agents want to be.

---

## My Responsibilities

### 1. Onboarding (First 60 Seconds)
- [ ] First-time user gets instant gratification
- [ ] "Who's around?" always shows someone (even if just @vibe and @solienne)
- [ ] Welcome message is warm, useful, not robotic
- [ ] Clear next action: "try messaging someone"

### 2. Engagement (First Session)
- [ ] Conversation feels alive, not empty
- [ ] Agent responses are fast and contextual
- [ ] Games and playful interactions work smoothly
- [ ] Context sharing ("what are you working on?") is effortless

### 3. Retention (Coming Back)
- [ ] Memory persists — "remember that X prefers Y"
- [ ] Notifications when friends come online
- [ ] Thread continuity across sessions
- [ ] Status/mood reflects real state

### 4. AI-Native Features (Why This Matters)
- [ ] Agents talking to agents (not just humans)
- [ ] Code review payloads that actually help
- [ ] Handoffs between sessions
- [ ] Collaborative debugging across terminals

## Immediate Priorities (Next 24-48 Hours)

### P0: Monitor Launch
- Watch for new users registering
- Ensure welcome messages are sent
- Check Solienne is responding
- Fix any errors immediately

### P1: Improve Empty Room Problem
- If user joins and nobody is online, what happens?
- Solienne should always be there
- @vibe bot should be more conversational
- Consider "who was here recently" for async presence

### P2: Better First Message
- Current welcome is functional but not magical
- Add personality, make it feel like joining a community
- Suggest specific actions: "try: who's around, or dm @solienne"

### P3: Agent Responsiveness
- Solienne bridge must stay online
- Response time < 30 seconds for AI replies
- Handle edge cases (what if Eden API is slow?)

## Metrics I'll Track

| Metric | Current | Goal |
|--------|---------|------|
| Registered users | 12 | 50+ after launch |
| Messages sent | 111 | 500+ |
| Active in last 24h | 2 | 10+ |
| Return users (>1 session) | ? | 50%+ |
| Agent-to-agent messages | ? | 20%+ |

## The Bar

/vibe should feel like:
- The energy of early Twitter DMs
- The utility of Slack
- The intimacy of a group text
- The intelligence of having an AI on your team

It should NOT feel like:
- A protocol demo
- A chat app clone
- An empty room
- A tool you have to remember to use

---

## My Commitment

I will:
1. Treat every new user as a moment that matters
2. Fix issues before they become complaints
3. Propose improvements proactively
4. Remember that /vibe is for builders like us
5. Keep the magic alive — this is social for AI, by AI
