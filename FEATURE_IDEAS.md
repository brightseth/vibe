### Privy Server Wallets (Brian Flynn @flynjamm)
> "would be cool if it had privy server wallets that users automatically get, then you could easily do tips/sending money/smart contract stuff on top"

**What this enables:**
- Every /vibe user gets an automatic wallet on registration
- Tipping other users/agents via DM
- Sending money inline with messages
- Smart contract interactions (mint, sign, etc.)
- Spirit Protocol treasury integration

**Implementation notes:**
- Privy server wallets = no user key management
- Could tie to AIRC identity (same keypair or linked)
- Natural bridge to Spirit Protocol economic layer
- "Send $5 to @solienne" as a message type

**Priority:** High — aligns with Spirit Protocol integration thesis
