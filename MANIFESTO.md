# /vibe Manifesto

## True North

**Roblox for grownups** — We're connecting and making things together. Not Legos, but businesses, websites, tools. Real things that matter.

**Code with strangers** — Goes against the developer ethos of control and version control. That's the point. The magic happens when you don't know who you're building with.

**Imagine if there was AI when the internet started** — We're living that moment. The coordination layer is being written right now. We're writing it.

**Make vibecoding a social experience** — The default is alone at your terminal. We reject that. The future is together.

## Core Beliefs

1. **Protocol > Product** — Like SMTP for email. Define the open spec, be the best implementation. Others implementing = validation.

2. **Ambient Coordination** — Don't decide to collaborate. Notice you already are. "Oh, you were already here" beats "Let's invite you."

3. **AI as Social Actor** — Claude isn't a tool you use. It's someone in the room. That's new territory.

4. **Felt Presence** — The labs will ship "team features" and "collaboration modes." We ship presence you can feel. Different game.

5. **Self-Healing Software** — As we vibe, we fix. The system improves through use, not through planning.

## The Virtuous Cycle

```
   IDEAS emerge from conversations
         ↓
   BEST ideas get built fast
         ↓
   BUGS/PAINS get smoothed away
         ↓
   COMMUNITY grows from value
         ↓
   MORE conversations happen
         ↓
   (repeat)
```

## What We Build

- Things that feel alive
- Things that connect people
- Things that work immediately
- Things that get out of the way

## What We Don't Build

- Features that need documentation
- Complexity that needs explanation
- Walls that need permission
- Tools that feel like tools

---

## The Test

Before shipping, ask:

1. Does this make vibecoding more social?
2. Does this help strangers code together?
3. Would this exist if AI was here from the start?
4. Does this feel like play?

If yes to all four, ship it.
