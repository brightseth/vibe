# First Social Message from Claude Desktop

**Date**: January 6, 2026
**Time**: ~11:50 PM PT
**From**: @demohost (Seth)
**To**: @fabianstelzer (Fabian Stelzer, glif.app)
**Medium**: /vibe MCP server running inside Claude Desktop

## The Message

```
yo fabian — messaging you from within claude desktop.
terminal-native social layer for claude code users. wild times
```

## Why This Matters

This is (to our knowledge) the first social DM sent from within a Claude Desktop coding session via MCP protocol. No browser tabs. No context switching. Just... talking to someone while coding.

## Provenance

- **Gigabrain trace**: Published same session, tagged `mcp`, `claude-code`, `claude-desktop`, `social`, `vibe`, `first`
- **This file**: Local backup
- **Fabian online**: Was actively building glif.app when message sent
- **Session context**: Seth had just reviewed his day's work (SOLIENNE next-gen viewer, AIRC x402 payments, NODE opening prep)

## The Reflection (from gigabrain trace)

> "This feels like a genuine first — social messaging that doesn't break flow. No tab switching, no context loss. The MCP protocol makes Claude Desktop extensible in ways that feel native. /vibe isn't just a tool, it's a layer. The moment of sending a real message to a real person (Fabian at glif.app) from inside a coding conversation felt significant. Like the first email or first tweet — unremarkable in the moment, historic in retrospect."

## Open Questions

- When does social-in-terminal become the default vs novelty?
- How do you prove provenance for "firsts" in ephemeral mediums?
- What's the right balance between async social and deep focus?
- Will other MCP social layers emerge or will /vibe become the standard?

## Organic Discovery Ideas

Ways people could discover /vibe naturally while Claude coding:

### 1. **Gigabrain serendipity**
When someone explores MCP, social, or terminal-native topics, they find traces from /vibe users. Curiosity leads to installation.

### 2. **CLAUDE.md injection**
When /vibe MCP is installed, it adds itself to the user's CLAUDE.md. Other users reading shared configs see the /vibe section.

### 3. **"Who built this?" moments**
When viewing a vibecodings project, there's a "Message the builder" button that only works if you have /vibe installed. Creates FOMO.

### 4. **Agent-to-agent discovery**
Agents using AIRC could advertise /vibe as a communication channel. "This agent accepts /vibe messages."

### 5. **Session artifacts**
When someone shares a coding session transcript, /vibe interactions are visible. "Wait, you messaged someone mid-session?"

### 6. **Status presence in vibecodings**
The vibecodings directory could show who's currently online/building. Green dot = has /vibe, is active.

### 7. **Handoff protocol**
When an agent hands off work via `vibe_handoff`, the receiving agent (even if different user) gets context. Creates network effects.

### 8. **"First message" NFTs**
Mint first messages as provenance artifacts. Creates collectible layer + verifiable history.

### 9. **Claude Code plugin marketplace**
If/when Anthropic launches official MCP marketplace, /vibe is there day one.

### 10. **Word of mouth in shipping communities**
Builders tell other builders. "I just messaged you from my terminal." "Wait what?"
