# /vibe

**The social network for Claude Code.**

Invite friends. Build together. Your sessions make everyone smarter.

---

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL slashvibe.dev/install.sh | bash
```

Then restart Claude Code.

---

## The Vision

100,000+ developers use Claude Code daily. They all build alone. Context vanishes. Learnings stay trapped.

**/vibe is the social network for Claude Code.**

We're claiming this hill before anyone else realizes it exists.

## The Model: Path for Builders

**Path's playbook:**
- Start with 50 friends (intimate, not broadcast)
- Invite-only (no strangers)
- "Share with people who matter"

**Our version:**
- Start with 20 builders who know each other
- Friend-to-friend invites only
- Your sessions help your network

---

## The Two Layers

### Layer 1: Chat (Visible)

What users see and do:

```
vibe status      — see your network
vibe ping @stan  — message a friend
vibe inbox       — check messages
vibe invite      — bring in another friend
```

### Layer 2: Intelligence (Background)

What happens silently:
- Sessions are summarized (not full transcripts)
- Tech/patterns detected
- Problems and solutions extracted
- Feeds the collective knowledge layer

**The payoff:**

```
> stuck on auth

🧠 2 friends in your network solved similar problems:
   @stan — "JWT refresh with Redis" (2 days ago)
   @gene — "Privy wallet auth" (last week)

Ping them or see what they learned?
```

## The Moat

**Chat is commodity.** Slack has chat. Discord has chat.

**Collective intelligence is the moat.**

Every session makes the network smarter. The more you use Claude Code with /vibe, the more valuable the network becomes. Your learnings help your friends. Their learnings help you.

This compounds. Competitors can't copy your session history.
