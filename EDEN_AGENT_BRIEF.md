# /vibe Alpha Launch — Agent Brief

## What You're Helping With

I'm launching /vibe — a communication layer inside Claude Code. DMs without leaving the terminal.

**Phase 1 scope (strict):**
- `vibe init` — set identity
- `vibe who` — see who's online
- `vibe dm` — send messages
- `vibe inbox` — check messages

**NOT in Phase 1:** No AI traces, no collective intelligence, no "sessions make everyone smarter." Just messaging.

## The Ask

Help me send 20 personal alpha invites across multiple channels:
- **X/Twitter** — public signal + DMs to builders
- **Discord** — DMs to Claude Code / AI dev communities
- **Telegram** — group chats and direct messages
- **WhatsApp/iMessage** — close friends and collaborators

## Three Invite Templates

### Friendly (for people I DM often)
```
Hey [NAME] — built DMs inside Claude Code.

Instead of switching to Discord, I just type "vibe dm @you" and you get it.

2 min: curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brightseth/vibe/main/install.sh | bash

After restart, run "vibe init" then:
vibe dm @seth "installed"

That way I know it worked.
```

### Blunt (for active builders)
```
[NAME] — communication layer for Claude Code. DM without leaving terminal.

curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brightseth/vibe/main/install.sh | bash

Restart, run "vibe init", then:
vibe dm @seth "installed"

Testing if people actually use this instead of switching apps.
```

### Skeptic (for honest feedback)
```
[NAME] — testing a hypothesis: would you DM someone from Claude Code if you could?

I built it. 2 min:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brightseth/vibe/main/install.sh | bash

Restart, "vibe init", then DM me:
vibe dm @seth "installed"

Honest feedback wanted. Either this is useful or I should stop.
```

## Tiered Invite List (Order Matters)

**Tier 1 (5 people):** People I already DM frequently → Friendly template
**Tier 2 (10 people):** Active Claude Code / terminal builders → Blunt template
**Tier 3 (5 people):** Skeptics who'll give honest feedback → Skeptic template

---

## Platform Guidance

### X/Twitter
- One public post: "Built DMs inside Claude Code. Testing with 20 builders. DM if you want early access."
- DM the blunt template to builders I follow

### Discord
- DM only (no channel spam)
- Target: Claude Code users, AI dev communities, vibecoding folks

### Telegram/WhatsApp/iMessage
- Close friends and collaborators
- Use friendly template
- Personal touch: reference what they're building

## What I Need From You

1. **Draft 5 personalized Tier 1 messages** — I'll tell you who
2. **Draft the X post** — short, no hype, developer-focused
3. **Help me track** who I've sent to and who's responded

---

## Success Metric

**Did at least one person DM another person inside Claude Code without being prompted to?**

That's the only thing that matters.
