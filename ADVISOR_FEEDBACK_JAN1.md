# Advisor Feedback (Jan 1, 2026)

## The Tension

**Advisors' core thesis:** "Refusal to be helpful" — constraint builds trust.

**Seth's counter:** Proactive intelligence IS the magic. We want Claude to connect people in ways they never imagined. Our intentions are good.

## Advisor Recommendations

### Philosophy: "Negative Constraint" Model
- Explicit engagement only
- Shown, not harvested
- Promotion, not capture

### What /vibe Should NOT Do (per advisors)
- No ambient monitoring
- No behavioral scoring
- No proactive recommendations ("You should talk to X")
- No feeds or channels
- No automatic memory

### Rename: "Presence Inference" → "Presence Annotation"
- Emphasize labeling explicit signals, not hidden reasoning
- Must be explainable in one sentence
- Stateless (non-accumulative)

### @vibe Agent Constraints
- Never initiates beyond welcome
- Never suggests connections proactively
- Never references memory unless asked

## Seth's Disagreement (Noted)

> "I do think we should be surfacing ambient awareness and suggest connections and be a little more proactive since our intentions are good and we want to leverage magic Claude Code AGI style intelligence to connect people and help them coordinate and collaborate in ways they may have never imagined."

## Possible Synthesis

| Feature | Constrained | Proactive | Balance |
|---------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Connections | Pull only | Push suggestions | Opt-in: "find collaborators" |
| Awareness | No monitoring | Surface activity | Show don't push |
| @vibe | Respond only | Active host | Warm but bounded |
| Memory | Never auto | Auto-capture | Promotion with nudge |

## The Real Question

Can we build proactive intelligence that feels like **serendipity** rather than **surveillance**?

The test isn't "did we avoid being creepy" — it's "did we create magic moments that couldn't happen without AI mediation?"

---

## Wedge Test (Advisor Version)
> "Did someone save a memory, then recall it days later to inform a decision?"

## Wedge Test (Seth Version)
> "Did Claude connect two people who would never have found each other, and something good came from it?"

---

*Keep both tests. Succeed at both.*
