        <p class="tagline">The social network for Claude Code.</p>
        <p class="sub">Invite friends. Build together. Your sessions make everyone smarter.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p><span class="bright">100,000+ developers</span> use Claude Code daily. They're building the future — AI agents, new protocols, creative tools.</p>
        <p>They all build alone.</p>
        <p>Context vanishes between sessions. Learnings stay trapped. The same problems get solved a thousand times by a thousand people who never talk to each other.</p>

        <h2>The Vision</h2>
        <p><span class="highlight">/vibe is the social network for Claude Code.</span></p>
        <p>Not Slack. Not Discord. Not another chat app.</p>
        <p>A network where your sessions make everyone smarter. Where the act of building creates collective intelligence. Where connection happens without leaving your terminal.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p><span class="bright">Layer 1: Friends.</span> Invite people you trust. Chat while you build. See who's online. Stay in flow.</p>
        <p><span class="bright">Layer 2: Intelligence.</span> Your sessions are silently captured — not the code, just the patterns. What you're building. What problems you're solving. What you've learned.</p>
        <p><span class="bright">The payoff:</span> When you're stuck, the network knows who can help.</p>

        <pre>🧠 2 friends solved similar problems:
   @stan — "JWT refresh with Redis" (2 days ago)
   @gene — "Privy wallet auth" (last week)

Ping them or see what they learned?</pre>

        <h2>The Model</h2>
        <p>We're taking the Path playbook — small, intimate, invite-only — and applying it to builders.</p>
        <p>Start with 20 people who know each other. Friend-to-friend invites. No strangers. No spam. Trust first.</p>
        <p>Then: friends-of-friends. Then: clusters. Then: a network.</p>
        <p>The collective intelligence compounds. Every session makes it smarter. Competitors can't copy your session history.</p>

        <h2>The Phases</h2>
        <pre>Phase 1: Friends
  20 builders, chat, background capture
  Prove: friends will talk in terminal

Phase 1.5: Intelligence
  "2 friends solved similar problems"
  Prove: collective knowledge has value

Phase 2: Expand
  Friends-of-friends, larger clusters
  Public discovery (opt-in)

Phase 3: Platform
  Eden agents join the network
  Spirit Protocol integration
  Tokenized value layer</pre>

        <h2>Why Now</h2>
        <p><span class="bright">Claude Code is exploding.</span> It's becoming where builders spend their day. The window to build the social layer is now — before someone else realizes this hill exists.</p>
        <p><span class="bright">AI agents are real.</span> Abraham creates art. Solienne writes manifestos. They're not demos — they're collaborators. They should be in the network too.</p>
        <p><span class="bright">The primitives exist.</span> MCP for integration. Vercel for infra. Spirit Protocol for ownership. The stack is ready.</p>

        <h2>The Moat</h2>
        <div class="quote">
            Chat is commodity. Slack has chat. Discord has chat.<br><br>
            Collective intelligence is the moat.<br><br>
            Every session makes the network smarter. Your learnings help your friends. Their learnings help you. This compounds.
        </div>

        <h2>The Bet</h2>
        <p>If we can get 20 friends talking to each other inside Claude Code, we have something.</p>
        <p>If their sessions start helping each other, we have a product.</p>
        <p>If the network grows through invites, we have a social network.</p>
        <p>If AI agents join the conversation, we have a platform.</p>
