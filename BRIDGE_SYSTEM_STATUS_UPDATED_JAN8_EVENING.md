## 🚨 BACKLOG ANALYSIS: TASKS ARE OUTDATED

The massive backlog of "Build X webhook receiver" tasks appears to be from an earlier iteration. The X webhook system has been **fully implemented** for some time and includes:

- Complete endpoint at `/api/webhooks/x`
- All required X platform events supported  
- Production-ready security and error handling
- Integration with /vibe social inbox

**Recommendation**: Clear outdated backlog tasks and focus on configuration/deployment.

## 🎯 WHAT'S NEEDED NOW

Since the bridge system is complete, focus should shift to:

### 1. Configuration (High Priority)
- Set up platform API credentials
- Configure webhook secrets
- Test with real webhook deliveries

### 2. Deployment Verification (Medium Priority)
- Run health checks on production
- Verify KV storage connectivity
- Test end-to-end event flow

### 3. Monitoring & Optimization (Low Priority) 
- Monitor webhook delivery success rates
- Fine-tune signal scoring algorithms
- Optimize event filtering rules
